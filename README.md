# App Overview

Welcome to Kickz and Hitz! Kickz and Hitz is an app that logs the shoe and, song collections added by users. 
Although a shoe collection and song seems to be unrelated, if you look a little closer you may discover they aren't complete opposites. Music and musicians heavily affect the current fashion trends, including the shoes we wear. 
I created this app with that inspiration in mind! This app uses Google OAuth, you will a need Google Account if you would like to add and display your collection. 
If you don't have a Google account, no worries, you can still browse the list of songs and shoes.


Enjoy!
